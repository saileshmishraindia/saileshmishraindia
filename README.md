My multifaceted approach combines technical expertise with strong problem-solving skills, making me an asset in tackling complex engineering challenges and pushing the frontiers of what's possible in integrated circuit design.


### My Engineering Journey 
- In my **first year**, I built a strong electronics foundation through both theory and practical application. I mastered basic electronic components and Network theorems, which helped me understand circuit behavior and analysis. I implemented Boolean logic circuits and simulated analog circuits using industry tools like LT Spice and EDA Playground. This hands-on experience with both hardware and simulation tools confirmed my interest in VLSI design and set the stage for my advanced coursework.


- During my **Second year**, I significantly advanced my VLSI design capabilities by immersing myself in hardware description languages and digital design. I developed proficiency in Verilog HDL, implementing various digital circuits from scratch. My work included designing complex sequential circuits like custom registers, counters, and frequency dividers.I leveraged multiple tools including EDA Playground for HDL simulation, CircuitVerse for digital design, and virtualization platforms like Oracle VM and VirtualBox for EDA tool deployment. This comprehensive practical experience strengthened my foundation in digital design and VLSI.


- During my **Third Year**, I specialized in Digital System Verification, focusing on SystemVerilog implementation. A significant achievement was developing a comprehensive testbench for APB protocol verification, where I successfully validated both master and slave interfaces. I implemented advanced SystemVerilog concepts including events, packets, and object-oriented programming features to create robust verification environments. Working with real-world protocols and industry specifications enhanced my understanding of modern verification methodologies."


- Interned at the Advanced VLSI Lab, SIT in my final year, gaining exposure to:</br>
     - Cell characterization
     - Standard cell layout
     - PDK training
- Worked with FPGAs, including the Spartan6.
- Conducted a workshop on RTL to GDS flow using open-source tools for juniors.

### Projects
Some of the major projects that i have done in my academic carrer are :
- [**16 byte SRAM design**](https://github.com/Priyansu122/SRAM-Project-2023): </br>
    - Designed a 16-byte SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) using the 180nm technology node, employing a full custom approach.
    - This project is a comprehensive training initiative completed during my internship. It involved the entire process from design and characterization to layout, providing me with hands-on experience in full 
      custom design
  
- [**Digital Temperature Monitor**](https://github.com/silicon-efabless/tt06-silicon-tinytapeout-lm07?tab=readme-ov-file#project-description): </br>
    - This project implements a digital temperature monitor by connecting a temperature sensor ([LM70](docs/datasheet-LM70-TI-tempSensor.pdf) [`docs/datasheet-LM70-TI-tempSensor.pdf`]) and a three-segment display to measure and display a range of $0-99^\circ C$ or $0-99^\circ F$ with an accuracy of $\pm 2^\circ C$.
    - In this project, I have enhanced the design by adding several new features and ensuring it is ready for fabrication using the [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) platform.
